I came across the following situation:

He had created a form on google drive where he would collapse a series of information and the person would submit a photo.
But google drive saves the files with the date and time of file upload and user logged in google.
I already needed the files to have the name based on one of the submitted columns.

To solve this, I created the shell script that downloads the files and saves it with the name of the specified column, from a spreadsheet with the extension '.csv'.

I hope this code can help other people and anything you feel the urge to ask.
